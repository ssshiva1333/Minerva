# TCP Reverse Shell Payload
This TCP reverse shell is for Windows OS and written by using Golang.     
You can send cmd commands to the computer of victim and take the output of the cmd commands.         
Before making it an executable file, you should change the ip addresses on files and build it by using "go build -ldflags "-H windowsgui" target-payload.go"".     
If you build it by using that command, victim will not be able to see terminal.
